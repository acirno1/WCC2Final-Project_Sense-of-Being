## Instructions:

This project was developed using TouchDesigner and implements real-time hand tracking via Leap Motion.
The audience can control the background ambient sound volume by moving their hand vertically above the sensor.
When the user clenches and then releases their hand, a thunder sound is triggered, and the visual particle field dynamically reacts to the audio features.
